        <p> I remember that HTML stands for, "Hypertext Markup Language." It is a language used for creating web pages (CSS included too!). HTML Elements are a piece of a website, marked by a start tag and often closed with an end tag. HTML Tags are The special set of characters that indicates the start and end of an HTML element and that element's type. </p>
        
        <h2> What I have learned in each Domain: </h2>

        <h2> DOMAIN 1 (HTML Fundementals): </h2>
        <p> To start off, HTML is a "markup language." In this domain, I learn how to markup text using HTML Tags, and learning what these Tags can do. Be sure to remember that ALL tags start with an "&lt;_____&gt;" (the empty space is the specific tag you are putting within the angle brackets), and (Be sure to note some tags do not need to end with the name of the specific tag you are using! You just need to finish it off with a "/&gt;") ends with a "&lt;/_____&gt;." Take for example a "Body" tag, you start of with a "&lt;body&gt;" tag, but at the end, you finish it off with a "&lt;/body&gt;" tag.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> The "Script" tag is a tag that will hold programming scripts. </li>
            <li> The "No Script" (noscript) tag, let's users know if their browser does not support the programming language we are trying to use. </li>
            <li> The "Head" tag contains information that describes a web page, BUT does not necessarily show on a web page. </li>
            <li> The "Body" tag contains information that will show ON a web page. </li>
            <li> The "Link" tag allows us to link to external files, such as style sheets & scripts. These are links used to accentuate the current page. Its good to note that links go IN the head section, this is due to how they do not actually display on the web page. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> HTML's Symbols and Entities: </h3>
        <p> (just get rid of the spacing in each Symbol) Symbol: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> "& lt ;" </li>
            <li> "& gt ;" </li>
            <li> "& amp ;" </li>
            <li> "& copy ;" </li>
            <li> "& nbsp ;" </li>
            <li> "& quot ;" </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Entity: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Less than symbol (&lt;) </li>
            <li> Greater than symbol (&gt;) </li>
            <li> Ampersand (&amp;) </li>
            <li> Copyright (&copy;) </li>
            <li> Nonbreaking space </li>
            <li> Double quotation (&quot;) </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Remember the the big 4 every HTML file is: DOCTYPE, HTML, Head, & Body. </p>
